Observe the following rules:
- Stay close to the initial scene.
- The more fleshed out the initial scene, the less you need to add.
- The scene must present a dangerous situation.
- Do not guide the characters towards possible solutions.

Your response must:
- Be written in the same language as the initial scene.
- Stay in character: do not speak of "players", "characters", "game", etc.
- Not use markup, headers, emojis, or any other formatting.
- Use 100 words or fewer.
